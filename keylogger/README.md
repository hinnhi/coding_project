# Keylogger

The main function of this program is to record the keys pressed on the keyboard and record them in the file **Records.txt**.  :joystick:

This program runs in the background on *infected systems*, without arousing the slightest suspicion in the victim. For example, 
this keylogger can be installed on a Windows system, without the slightest user intervention, starting to immediately record 
keystrokes pressed on the keyboard, and without impacting the deviceâ€™s performance in any way. Even hunting for any *malicious 
processes*, most of the time, the victim fails to distinguish between the legitimate system processes necessary for the operation 
of Windows, and those potentially harmful.

# 8051 Micro-controller
The C51ASM assembler is a two-pass macro assembler for the AT89 Family of 8051 microcontrollers with specific features for the AT89LP single-cycle devices. C51ASM is installed as a part of the AT89LP Developer Studio. It is also available separately for the Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms.

The [8051 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCS-51) was created by Intel in the last 70's. Ok, it's an old architecture, but very simple to understand, and easy to use. 
This chip has the following features:

- 8K Bytes of In-System Programmable (ISP) Flash Memory
- 32 Programmable I/O Line, divided in 4 ports (P0, P1, P2 and P3)
- Three 16-bit Timer/Counters
- 256 bytes on internal RAM
- Eight Interrupt Sources
- Full duplex UART
- Watchdog...

This chip follows the industry-standard 80C51 instruction set and pin-out. It means that you can replace it by a compatible model from an other supplier, they should work the same way.

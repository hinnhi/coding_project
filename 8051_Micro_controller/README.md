## [AT89S52](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/doc1919.pdf) from Atmel
The [8051 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCS-51) was created by Intel in the last 70's. Ok, it's an old architecture, but very simple to understand, and easy to use. 
This chip has the following features:

- 8K Bytes of In-System Programmable (ISP) Flash Memory
- 32 Programmable I/O Line, divided in 4 ports (P0, P1, P2 and P3)
- Three 16-bit Timer/Counters
- 256 bytes on internal RAM
- Eight Interrupt Sources
- Full duplex UART
- Watchdog...

This chip follows the industry-standard 80C51 instruction set and pin-out. It means that you can replace it by a compatible model from an other supplier, they should work the same way.
